              For legal reasons, our university asks that you read and accept the terms of our liability waiver. Again, as we mentioned in the original lottery application - you <strong> must </strong> be 18 years or older or an OSU undergraduate by the day of the event, or <strong> we will refuse you admission at the door. We will be checking ID. </strong>

              By writing my name below, I affirm that I have read and accepted the terms of the liability waiver above, and will be either an OSU undergraduate or 18 years or older at the time of the event.
